To find the min and max of 2 numbers
```python 
max(a,b) => a  if a >= b else b
Python difference between / & //
Python 3, they made the / operator do a floating-point division, and added the // operator to do integer division (i.e. quotient without remainder); whereas in Python 2, the / operator was simply integer division, unless one of the operands was already a floating point number.
```
